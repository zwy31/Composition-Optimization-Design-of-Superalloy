# Multi-scale Calculation Aided Composition Optimization Design of Low Density and High Strength Nickel-based Superalloy#
codes used in the study "Multi-scale Calculation Aided Composition Optimization Design of Low Density and High Strength Nickel-based Superalloy" by Wenyuan Zhao, Qingguo Ren, Zhihao Yao*, Jie Zhao, He Jiang, Jianxin Dong

The following are the python codes that were used to conduct this work:

1.Regression algorithm to calculate yield strength.py: Machine learning regression algorithm was used to predict the strength of the new alloy.

2.Feature correlation evaluation.py: Feature correlation coefficient calculation.

3.Linear regression.py: The strength contribution coefficient of each element was calculated by linear regression.

4.Genetic algorithms.py: Genetic algorithm to explore the optimal alloy composition.
